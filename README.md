# lua-luaunitcore
LuaUnitCore is a unit-testing framework for the stripped down and modified Lua on the online game development platform "CORE".

It is fork of
https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit

Currently, the tool is published as Community project, so that you can load it as "CORE Project" into your CORE IDE to modify and run it. In the CORE IDE on Windows, select "Create / New Project / Community Projects" and search for 

"hemmerling_luaunit"

. Formally, it is also published at 
http://www.coregames.com/games/f67aaa/hemmerlingluaunit
, but there is no benefit of running this application, at this moment.

It might be later be published as "CORE Template" too.

In the current state, it is just useful to use it in the internal simulator of the CORE IDE, after loading it as "CORE Community Project".
