Description: "hemmerling_luaunit is a unit-testing framework for the stripped down and modified Lua on the online game development platform \"CORE\".\r\n\r\nFollow me on Discord ( http://discord.gg/WfsbJmN5r5 ) !\r\n\r\nThe GitHub repository is at\r\nhttps://github.com/hemmerling/lua-luaunitcore\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fork of https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit\r\n\r\nIt is NOT a \"game\", but a software development tool.\r\n\r\nThe tool is published as \"Open for Editing\" CORE application, i.e. as CORE community project. So that you can load it as \"CORE Project\" into your CORE IDE to modify and run it. In the CORE IDE, select \"Create / New Project / Community Projects\" and search for\r\n\r\n\"hemmerling_luaunit\"\r\n\r\n. Formally, it is also published at \r\nhttp://www.coregames.com/games/f67aaa/hemmerlingluaunit \r\n, but there is no benefit of running this application, at this moment.\r\n\r\nIt might be later be published as \"CORE Template\" too.\r\n\r\nIn the current state, it is just useful to use it in the internal simulator of the CORE IDE, after loading it as \"CORE Community Project\".\r\n\r\nBug: At this moment, the Lua script file \"run_unit_tests\" ( testing \"test_luaunit\" ) does not work, properly :-("
